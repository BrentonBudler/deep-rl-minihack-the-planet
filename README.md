# Minihack The Planet
## Learning Minihack environments using DQN and Actor-Critic architectures
This repository serves as the codebase for a Reinforcement Learning assignment at The University of The Witwatersrand. The repo contains DQN and Actor-Critic Implementations in PyTorch that have been trained on a variety of different prebuilt Minihack environments. Minihack is a RL framework based on the popular open source game Nethack.
